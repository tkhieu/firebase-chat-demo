Test project

You are expected to implement a small chat application. 

### 1. Add dummy chat view
* It has a chat message list
* It has an edit text view
* TODO: add mock

### 2. Integrate to Firebase
* Follow installation steps https://www.firebase.com/docs/android/quickstart.html
* Firebase reference is https://mysquar-test.firebaseio.com/chat

### 3. Write to Firebase
* For each message submitted in step #1, it should also be saved to Firebase
* Save data to Firebase https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/guide/saving-data.html
* Use `Getting the Unique ID Generated by push()`
* Data structure should look like this: 
```
{
  "chat": {
    $messageId1: "Message 1",
    $messageId2: "Message 2"
  }
}
```

### 4. Read from Firebase
* Read data from Firebase https://www.firebase.com/docs/android/guide/retrieving-data.html
* Should use `Child Added` event type, as the messages are saved in a list
* After this step, 2 devices can chat together

### 5. Add user name to chat
* Generate a unique user id, `"User " + Build.ID`
* Change data structure to support user name
* Change chat message item type to reflect sender and receiver
* TODO: add mock

### 6. Support offline mode
* Chat messages after being synced from Firebase should be cached locally with SQlite
* Should not use `Firebase.getDefaultConfig().setPersistenceEnabled(true);` as it is not stable
* Can use any kind of ORM in Android
